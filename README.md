# BabyNamesSince1888

All visualizations are available on Tableau Public at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/long.phan8394/viz/BabyNamesSince1880/BabyNamesOverview

In the dashboard "Baby Names Since 1880", you will find:
* Popularity trends of each name from 1888 to 2022
* Top 5 most popular names for each first letter
* Top 20 baby boys/girls names of each year (in animated bar chart form)
* Names with the most babies born (of all time/by year)
* Names that are similar to your own with details on the number of babies born and the longevity (i.e. number of years appeared) for each name

Instructions to those who want to reproduce the end-to-end process of making the visualization:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run the "babyNamesSince1888.py" script, which processes all the txt files within the "Names" folder. As a result, you will produce a csv file called "babyNamesSince1888.csv"
3. Open the Tableau workbook "BabyNamesSince1880.twb" and edit the connection so that the csv file can be loaded properly.
4. Enjoy!
